## Governance Principle

### JSON is Authority, Markdown is Reflection

**Documentation must be auto-generated from JSON source to prevent drift**

This principle means:
- All documentation comes FROM JSON sources
- No manually-written markdown for governed documentation
- Every build regenerates all documents (preventing drift)
- Developers edit JSON, not markdown
- Documentation is always in sync with system

---

## Core Governance Rules

- **Rule 1: JSON Authority Only – All documentation auto-generated from JSON**
- **Rule 2: Single Source of Truth – Every system has exactly ONE JSON authority**
- **Rule 3: Auto-Generation Pipeline – Every JSON authority has generation script**
- **Rule 4: Generated Document Marking – Auto-generated files marked with HTML comments**

## The Pattern in One Paragraph

**"JSON is Authority, Markdown is Reflection"** means:
Your system has ONE authoritative JSON file per documentation domain. On every build, a generation script reads that JSON and produces markdown documentation. Developers never hand-edit the markdown—they edit the JSON, run the build, and the markdown regenerates. This makes documentation **impossible to drift** from your system: same JSON always produces identical markdown. The governance framework itself is auto-generated, proving compliance with its own rules.

---

## Key Achievement

**This entire governance framework documents a pattern that it enforces upon itself:**

- ✅ Framework content stored in JSON (orchestration-audit-system-project-plan.json)
- ✅ All 4 framework documents auto-generated by scripts
- ✅ Each document marked with `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->` header
- ✅ Cannot edit framework documents without editing JSON
- ✅ Regenerated on every build
- ✅ **Governance system is self-enforcing**

This is architecture enforcement at its finest: the rules prevent violations of the rules themselves.

## Quick Commands

### Generate All Documentation
```bash
npm run build
```

### Generate Specific Governance Documents
```bash
npm run generate:governance:framework
npm run generate:governance:pattern
npm run generate:governance:implementation
npm run generate:governance:index
```

### Generate Telemetry Documentation
```bash
npm run generate:telemetry:instrumentation
npm run generate:telemetry:quickstart
npm run generate:telemetry:verification
npm run generate:telemetry:complete
```

## All Auto-Generated Documents

This system currently maintains 4 auto-generated documents:

**Governance Framework** (4 docs):
1. DOCUMENTATION_AUTO_GENERATION_GOVERNANCE.md
2. PATTERN_RECOGNITION_ACHIEVEMENT.md
3. DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
4. DOCUMENTATION_GOVERNANCE_INDEX.md

**Telemetry Governance** (4 docs):
1. DEMO_TELEMETRY_INSTRUMENTATION.md
2. TELEMETRY_GOVERNANCE_QUICKSTART.md
3. TELEMETRY_GOVERNANCE_VERIFICATION.md
4. TELEMETRY_GOVERNANCE_COMPLETE.md

## FAQ

### Q: Can I edit these markdown files?
**A**: No. They're marked `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->`. Pre-commit hooks will block commits. Edit the JSON source instead.

### Q: Where is the source of truth?
**A**: `orchestration-audit-system-project-plan.json` in the `governanceDocumentation` section.

### Q: How do I update documentation?
**A**: Edit the JSON in `governanceDocumentation.framework.*` or `governanceDocumentation.telemetryGovernance.*`, then run `npm run build`.

### Q: Why auto-generation?
**A**: Prevents documentation drift. Same JSON always produces identical markdown. Impossible to have stale docs.

### Q: What if I want to write manual documentation?
**A**: That's allowed for non-governed documents. Just don't mark them `<!-- AUTO-GENERATED -->` and they won't be auto-regenerated.

## Summary

Documentation governance is **complete**, **self-enforcing**, and **drift-proof**.

All documentation shown here is auto-generated from JSON authority, demonstrating that the governance pattern works and is compliant with its own rules.
