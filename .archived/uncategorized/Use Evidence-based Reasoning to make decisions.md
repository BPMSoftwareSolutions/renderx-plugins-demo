Use Evidence-based Reasoning to make decisions
Create scripts (python, typescript, CLI, etc.) to gain evidence before deciding on a real solution for an issue.
If we're trying to figure out what's wrong with an app, identify anti-patterns that go against the grain of clean-architecture principles
Create a failing test to demonstrate the issue that truly exist then make the test green by fixing the bug.
