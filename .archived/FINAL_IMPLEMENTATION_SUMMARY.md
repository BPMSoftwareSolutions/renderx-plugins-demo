## How Agents Will Use This

### Discovery
```bash
# "Where is the self-healing project?"
node scripts/query-project-knowledge.js "self-healing"
# Answer: packages/self-healing + structure + files
```

### Understanding
```bash
# "How is the system organized?"
Read: KNOWLEDGE_LAYERS_ARCHITECTURE.md
# Answer: 5-layer system with complete integration
```

### Implementation
```bash
# "How should I implement Phase 3?"
Read: packages/self-healing/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
# Use: Sprint workflow (7 phases, proven pattern)
```

### Health Checking
```bash
# "What's the current status?"
jq '.components[]' .generated/sli-metrics.json
# Answer: Canvas CRITICAL (49.31), Host SDK BEST (56.08)
```

## Critical Success Factors

✅ **README is updated** - Agent's first contact point  
✅ **Documentation is comprehensive** - 14+ files covering all layers  
✅ **Query tool is usable** - No steep learning curve  
✅ **Examples are concrete** - Can run them immediately  
✅ **Guidance is explicit** - "Always use the traceability system"  
✅ **Patterns are reusable** - Can apply to new projects  
✅ **Data is current** - Real production metrics in Layer 3

## Next Phase

**Phase 3d: SLO Definition Engine**

Ready to start immediately. Build `scripts/define-slo-targets.js` that:
- Reads: `.generated/sli-metrics.json` (real data)
- Outputs: `.generated/slo-targets.json` (realistic targets)
- Pattern: Use sprint workflow from self-healing
- Reference: Layer 4 architecture in KNOWLEDGE_LAYERS_ARCHITECTURE.md

## Summary

✨ **Mission Accomplished**

You now have a self-documenting system where:
- ✅ All agents know about the traceability system (README updated)
- ✅ They know how to use it (quick start + examples)
- ✅ They can find anything instantly (query tool)
- ✅ They understand the architecture (5 layers documented)
- ✅ They can implement confidently (patterns, workflows, guidance)

**System is 62.5% complete** with a clear path to 100% (6 more implementation phases).

**All agents are now informed and empowered.**
