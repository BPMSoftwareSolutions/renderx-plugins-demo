# Test Implementation Fixes for no-local-control-panel-sequences.spec.ts

This file contains suggested test implementations to fix AC compliance issues.

## [AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.3:1]

**AC Details:**
- Handler: control-panel/ui#initConfig
- Given: configuration metadata
- When: initConfig is called
- Then: configuration is loaded within 200ms, all fields are prepared for rendering, validation rules are attached

**Issues Found:**
- Missing Given setup: "configuration metadata"
- Missing When action: "initConfig is called"
- Missing Then assertion: "configuration is loaded within 200ms"
- Missing Then assertion: "all fields are prepared for rendering"
- Missing Then assertion: "validation rules are attached"

**Suggested Test Code:**

```typescript
  it('[AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.3:1] initConfig is called → configuration is loaded within 200ms', async () => {
    // Given: configuration metadata
    const config = { /* mock configuration */ };

    // When: initConfig is called
    const result = await initConfig(/* params */);

    // Then: configuration is loaded within 200ms, all fields are prepared for rendering, validation rules are attached
    const elapsed = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(200);
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
```
