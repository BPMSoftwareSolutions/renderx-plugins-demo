# Test Implementation Fixes for sequence-player-auto-convert.spec.ts

This file contains suggested test implementations to fix AC compliance issues.

## [AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:5.5:2]

**AC Details:**
- Handler: library-component/drag.preview#applyTemplateStyles
- Given: valid input parameters
- When: applyTemplateStyles processes them
- Then: results conform to expected schema, no errors are thrown, telemetry events are recorded with latency metrics

**Issues Found:**
- Missing When action: "applyTemplateStyles processes them"
- Missing Then assertion: "results conform to expected schema"
- Missing Then assertion: "no errors are thrown"
- Missing Then assertion: "telemetry events are recorded with latency metrics"

**Suggested Test Code:**

```typescript
  it('[AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:5.5:2] applyTemplateStyles processes them → results conform to expected schema', async () => {
    // Given: valid input parameters
    const input = { /* valid input parameters */ };

    // When: applyTemplateStyles processes them
    const result = await applyTemplateStyles(input);

    // Then: results conform to expected schema, no errors are thrown, telemetry events are recorded with latency metrics
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(typeof result).toBe('object');
    expect(() => result).not.toThrow();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
```

## [AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:5.5:4]

**AC Details:**
- Handler: library-component/drag.preview#applyTemplateStyles
- Given: performance SLA of < 1 second
- When: applyTemplateStyles executes
- Then: latency is consistently within target, throughput meets baseline requirements, resource usage stays within bounds

**Issues Found:**
- Missing When action: "applyTemplateStyles executes"
- Missing Then assertion: "latency is consistently within target"
- Missing Then assertion: "throughput meets baseline requirements"
- Missing Then assertion: "resource usage stays within bounds"

**Suggested Test Code:**

```typescript
  it('[AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:5.5:4] applyTemplateStyles executes → latency is consistently within target', async () => {
    // Given: performance SLA of < 1 second
    const startTime = performance.now();

    // When: applyTemplateStyles executes
    const result = await applyTemplateStyles(/* params */);

    // Then: latency is consistently within target, throughput meets baseline requirements, resource usage stays within bounds
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
