# Test Implementation Fixes for scene-4-transfer-hub.spec.ts

This file contains suggested test implementations to fix AC compliance issues.

## [AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.5:1]

**AC Details:**
- Handler: control-panel/ui#registerObservers
- Given: the registerObservers operation is triggered
- When: the handler executes
- Then: it completes successfully within < 1 second, the output is valid and meets schema, any required events are published

**Issues Found:**
- Missing Given setup: "the registerObservers operation is triggered"
- Missing When action: "the handler executes"
- Missing Then assertion: "it completes successfully within < 1 second"
- Missing Then assertion: "any required events are published"

**Suggested Test Code:**

```typescript
  it('[AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.5:1] the handler executes → it completes successfully within < 1 second', async () => {
    // Given: the registerObservers operation is triggered
    // Setup: the registerObservers operation is triggered
    const testData = {};

    // When: the handler executes
    const result = await registerObservers(/* params */);

    // Then: it completes successfully within < 1 second, the output is valid and meets schema, any required events are published
    const elapsed = performance.now() - startTime;
    expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(1000);
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(typeof result).toBe('object');
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
```
