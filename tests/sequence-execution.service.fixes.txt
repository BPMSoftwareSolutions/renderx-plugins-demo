# Test Implementation Fixes for sequence-execution.service.spec.ts

This file contains suggested test implementations to fix AC compliance issues.

## [AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.6:2]

**AC Details:**
- Handler: control-panel/ui#notifyReady
- Given: valid input parameters
- When: notifyReady processes them
- Then: results conform to expected schema, no errors are thrown, telemetry events are recorded with latency metrics

**Issues Found:**
- Missing When action: "notifyReady processes them"
- Missing Then assertion: "results conform to expected schema"
- Missing Then assertion: "no errors are thrown"
- Missing Then assertion: "telemetry events are recorded with latency metrics"

**Suggested Test Code:**

```typescript
  it('[AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.6:2] notifyReady processes them → results conform to expected schema', async () => {
    // Given: valid input parameters
    const input = { /* valid input parameters */ };

    // When: notifyReady processes them
    const result = await notifyReady(input);

    // Then: results conform to expected schema, no errors are thrown, telemetry events are recorded with latency metrics
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(typeof result).toBe('object');
    expect(() => result).not.toThrow();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
```

## [AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.6:4]

**AC Details:**
- Handler: control-panel/ui#notifyReady
- Given: performance SLA of < 50ms
- When: notifyReady executes
- Then: latency is consistently within target, throughput meets baseline requirements, resource usage stays within bounds

**Issues Found:**
- Missing Given setup: "performance SLA of < 50ms"
- Missing When action: "notifyReady executes"
- Missing Then assertion: "latency is consistently within target"
- Missing Then assertion: "throughput meets baseline requirements"
- Missing Then assertion: "resource usage stays within bounds"

**Suggested Test Code:**

```typescript
  it('[AC:renderx-web-orchestration:renderx-web-orchestration:1.6:4] notifyReady executes → latency is consistently within target', async () => {
    // Given: performance SLA of < 50ms
    const startTime = performance.now();

    // When: notifyReady executes
    const result = await notifyReady(/* params */);

    // Then: latency is consistently within target, throughput meets baseline requirements, resource usage stays within bounds
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result).toBeDefined();
  });
