# Issue #359 Implementation Status

## Overview
Issue #359 requests implementation of a telemetry-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that queries conductor logs to extract component behavior patterns and enrich AI-generated components with realistic integration and interaction data.

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Telemetry Parser - COMPLETE

**Implemented Components:**

1. **LogLoader** (`src/domain/logs/log-loader.ts`)
   - Loads log files from disk
   - Chunks logs into manageable pieces
   - Extracts metadata from log lines (timestamp, eventType, sessionId)
   - Infers event types from common log patterns (PluginMounted, Sequence, Event, Beat, Topic, Routing, etc.)
   - **Status**: Fully functional with tests passing ‚úÖ

2. **LogIndexer** (`src/domain/logs/log-indexer.ts`)
   - Indexes log chunks in memory
   - Supports querying by eventType filter
   - **Status**: Fully functional with tests passing ‚úÖ

3. **LogRetriever** (`src/domain/logs/log-retriever.ts`)
   - Retrieves log chunks by keyword search
   - Filters chunks containing specific keywords
   - **Status**: Fully functional with tests passing ‚úÖ

4. **Log Parser Services** (`src/ui/diagnostics/services/`)
   - `log-parser.service.ts` - Parses logs to structured ParsedExecution format
   - `log-converter.service.ts` - Converts console logs to JSON format
   - Extracts sequence execution data, movements, beats, timing
   - **Status**: Implemented for UI diagnostics ‚úÖ

**Test Results:**
```
‚úì src/domain/logs/__tests__/log-loader.test.ts (2 tests) ‚úÖ
‚úì src/domain/logs/__tests__/log-indexer.test.ts (1 test) ‚úÖ
‚úì src/domain/logs/__tests__/log-retriever.test.ts (1 test) ‚úÖ
Total: 4 tests passing
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 2: Pattern Extractor - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current State:**
- `PatternExtractor` exists (`src/domain/components/vector-store/ai/pattern-extractor.ts`)
- Currently extracts UI/CSS patterns from component library only
- Does NOT extract behavior patterns from telemetry logs

**What's Missing:**
- Telemetry-based pattern extraction (plugin/sequence mappings from logs)
- Event sequence extraction from conductor logs
- Timing pattern analysis
- Data flow pattern extraction (DataBaton changes)
- Canvas operation to plugin/sequence mapping

### ‚ùå Phase 3: RAG Integration - NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Current State:**
- `RAGEnrichmentService` exists (`packages/library/src/services/rag-enrichment.service.ts`)
- Only performs static library component type matching
- Does NOT use telemetry data

**What's Missing:**
- Integration with telemetry parser
- Telemetry-based interaction extraction
- Telemetry-based integration data enrichment
- Real execution pattern analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Phase 4: Testing & Validation - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Implemented:**
- Unit tests for LogLoader, LogIndexer, LogRetriever ‚úÖ
- All tests passing ‚úÖ
- No lint errors ‚úÖ

**Missing:**
- Tests for telemetry pattern extraction
- Tests for RAG enrichment with telemetry
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Validation tests for extracted patterns

## Sample Log Format

The system successfully parses conductor logs like:
```
[EventRouter] Topic 'library.component.drop.requested' definition: Object
[topics] Routing 'library.component.drop.requested' -> LibraryComponentPlugin::library-component-drop-symphony
üéº PluginInterfaceFacade.play(): LibraryComponentPlugin -> library-component-drop-symphony
üéº SequenceOrchestrator: Recording sequence execution: -u97cuu
üéº ExecutionQueue: Enqueued "Library Component Drop" with priority NORMAL
üéº SequenceExecutor: Executing movement "Drop" (1/1)
üéµ MovementExecutor: Starting movement "Drop" with 1 beats
üéØ Event: library:component:drop
üéº PluginManager: rehydrated 8 callback(s) for event library:component:drop
```

## Next Steps to Complete Issue #359

### Priority 1: Implement ComponentBehaviorExtractor
- Extract plugin/sequence mappings from logs
- Map canvas operations to sequences
- Extract event sequences and timing
- Analyze data flow patterns

### Priority 2: Enhance RAGEnrichmentService
- Accept telemetry logs as input
- Query logs for similar component behavior
- Extract realistic interactions from observed sequences
- Extract realistic integration from observed events

### Priority 3: Add Comprehensive Tests
- Unit tests for pattern extraction
- Integration tests for RAG enrichment
- Validation tests for extracted patterns

### Priority 4: Documentation
- Document telemetry log format
- Document pattern extraction algorithm
- Document RAG enrichment process

## Files to Create/Modify
