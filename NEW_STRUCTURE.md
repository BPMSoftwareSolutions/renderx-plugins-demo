# Source Structure Refactor (Issue #171)

This repository was reorganized to a layered, domain-first structure.

## Layers

```
src/
  core/            # Orchestration: conductor, events, manifests, startup, environment
  domain/          # Domain feature modules: layout, components, mapping, css, plugins (future)
  ui/              # React view layer (App + shared components)
  infrastructure/  # Low-level helpers (handlers path, future validation/security)
  vendor/          # Vendor shims and external UI adapters
  index.tsx        # Application entry (was main.tsx)
  global.css       # Global styles
```

### Dependency Direction

```
infrastructure → core → domain → ui
```

Cross-domain interactions occur only via topics/events (EventRouter) or manifest lookups.

## Mapping (Old → New)

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| `main.tsx` | `index.tsx` |
| `App.tsx` | `ui/App/App.tsx` |
| `conductor.ts` | `core/conductor/` (plus `sequence-registration.ts`, `runtime-loaders.ts`) |
| `EventRouter.ts` | `core/events/EventRouter.ts` |
| `env.ts` | `core/environment/env.ts` |
| `feature-flags/flags.ts` | `core/environment/feature-flags.ts` |
| `interactionManifest.ts` | `core/manifests/interactionManifest.ts` |
| `topicsManifest.ts` | `core/manifests/topicsManifest.ts` |
| `startupValidation.ts` | `core/startup/startupValidation.ts` |
| `layout/*` | `domain/layout/*` |
| `component-mapper/*` | `domain/mapping/component-mapper/*` |
| `jsonComponent.mapper.ts` | `domain/components/json/jsonComponent.mapper.ts` |
| `inventory/index.ts` | `domain/components/inventory/inventory.service.ts` |
| `cssRegistry/facade.ts` | `domain/css/cssRegistry.facade.ts` |
| `sanitizeHtml.ts` | `domain/css/sanitizeHtml.ts` (may move to `infrastructure/security`) |
| `components/PanelSlot.tsx` | `ui/shared/PanelSlot.tsx` |

Thin re-export shims exist temporarily; original files will be physically moved or removed after validation.

## Barrels
`core/conductor/index.ts` re-exports the conductor API + split modules. Add more barrels where external consumers benefit.

## Follow Ups
1. Remove legacy root files once all imports updated.
2. Introduce a `@/` path alias in `tsconfig.json` to reduce deep relative paths (optional).
3. Consider relocating `sanitizeHtml.ts` under `infrastructure/security/` if treated as a security boundary.
4. Co-locate tests next to implementations (incremental).
5. Evaluate extracting `core/` into a reusable host SDK package.

## Runtime Flow
```
[index.tsx]
  → core/environment
  → core/startup
  → core/manifests
  → core/conductor.init() + sequence registration
  → core/events/EventRouter.init()
  → React root render(App)
```

## Guardrails
* One-way dependency flow enforced by lint rules.
* EventRouter centralizes cross-feature dispatch.
* Reentrancy guard prevents feedback loops.
