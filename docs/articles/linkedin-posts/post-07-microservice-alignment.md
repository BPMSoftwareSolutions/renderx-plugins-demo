Title: Translating the Plugin Model to Microservices

This front-end architecture is a mirror-friendly blueprint for your service layer. Each plugin is already:
- Bounded Context (its own nouns + events)
- Public Contract (topic + sequence names)
- Internal Implementation Detail (beats + UI state)

How It Maps:
Front-End Plugin  →  Backend Service
Sequence          →  Application Use Case / Orchestrator
Beat              →  Internal Service Operation / Domain Function
Topic Event       →  Domain Event / Message Bus Publication
Manifest          →  Service API Descriptor / Async API Spec

Benefits of the Alignment:
- Fewer Translation Layers: Naming carries from UI to logs to services.
- Consistent Observability: play:Canvas.create → svc:canvas.create correlates via shared correlation ID pattern.
- Easier Contract Testing: Same JSON schemas power both sides.
- Safer Decomposition: Front-end already teaches devs to think in boundaries.

Migration Pattern:
1. Stabilize vocab (topics + sequence names) in manifests.
2. Introduce thin BFF (maps sequence → backend call).
3. Peel off heavy beats into remote calls (still one sequence from UI POV).
4. Promote these into standalone services with event emissions.
5. Replace BFF mapping with direct service choreography (or saga).

Avoid:
- Over-eager splitting (latency death by 12 services prematurely).
- Leaking internal service events back into UI (keep curated topic list).

Question: Could a new service team adopt a plugin’s manifest as their AsyncAPI draft? If yes, you’ve achieved cognitive alignment.
