Title: JSON as a Team Contract (Not Just Config)

Well-structured JSON can be more powerful than code for governing behavior:
- Component mappers define allowed props & classNames
- Feature flags express rollout intent separate from logic
- Topic / interaction manifests define pub/sub vocabulary

Benefits:
- Safer refactors (grep + validate schemas)
- AI-friendly (LLMs reason better on declarative shape)
- Faster onboarding (read the contracts first, code second)

Checklist to adopt:
[ ] Schemas with version + $id
[ ] Validation step in CI (fail fast)
[ ] Correlate runtime logs with manifest IDs
[ ] No “magic” strings outside manifests

Ask: Could a new engineer change behavior by only editing JSON + tests? If yes—you’ve reduced risk.

Illustration idea (json-contract.svg): Document icons (component.mapper.json, feature-flags.json) feeding into a shield icon → application.
