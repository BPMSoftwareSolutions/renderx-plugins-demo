# What the telemetry says (from your log)
I pulled the timing log you shared and did a quick pass to see where the cycles are going.

* Per‑beat floor: most beats land **\~28–35 ms** even for “light” ones like `…:ready:notify` and `…:observers:register`.
* Heaviest repeating work (by total time across runs):
  `control:panel:ui:schemas:load` (≈30.2 ms avg), `…:observers:register` (≈29.7 ms), `…:ready:notify` (≈29.3 ms), `…:config:load` (≈29.3 ms), `…:resolver:init` (≈29.2 ms).
* Sequence runtimes (per run, mean):
  **Control Panel UI Init ≈148 ms**, **UI Render ≈101 ms**, **Canvas Component Drag/Update ≈65–66 ms**.
* Library load sequence (once): **\~89 ms** with beats at **58 ms** and **30 ms**.

👉 Takeaway: the “floor” suggests the majority of wall‑time isn’t the event bus—it's the handler work (I/O, schema parsing, subscriptions, or triggering a React render) plus any telemetry/context packaging you do around each beat.

# “Beat emit vs. direct call” — what’s the real cost?

In‑process pub/sub is usually sub‑millisecond. Your beats still cost \~28–35 ms because of what they **do**, not because of how they’re **emitted**. The bus + conductor wrapper (correlation IDs, baton cloning/diffing, logging) adds overhead, but it’s likely **\~1–5 ms per beat** in your stack. The rest is handler work and render churn.

So yes: if you replace a beat with a plain method call inside the same tick, you might save **a few ms** of plumbing plus a log entry, but you’d lose the correlation, guardrails, priority/timing modes, and replay‑ability. The big wins will come from **reducing the number of beats** in hot paths and **coalescing render/compute**, not from swapping pub/sub for a direct call.

# Should you add a movement‑local iterator (one “lead” beat, internal sub‑handlers)?

Short answer: yes—for hot paths. Emit **one** beat for the movement, then run a local iterator that calls N sub‑handlers synchronously/awaited and reports **sub‑beat telemetry** (not full bus emissions).

Expected impact (based on your floor numbers):

* If the orchestration/bus+telemetry overhead is \~**3–5 ms/beat**, collapsing a 5‑beat movement into 1 bus beat + 4 internal calls saves **\~12–20 ms per run**.
* On **Control Panel UI Init (\~148 ms avg, 5 beats)** that’s a **\~8–14%** shave *before* other optimizations. If those beats also trigger intermediate renders, the savings can be higher because you’ll coalesce UI updates (see below).

# Concrete optimizations (ranked by likely ROI)

1. **Batch beats inside movements (your iterator idea)**

   * Keep: one externally visible “movement” beat for traceability/replay.
   * Add: `subBeats[]` telemetry on the same requestId (so replay can still step).
   * Save: \~3–5 ms plumbing *per* collapsed beat **+** fewer render passes (often bigger than the plumbing).

2. **Coalesce UI work to a single commit per sequence**

   * A lot of \~30 ms beats look like they’re nudging UI (register observers, ready notify, config load).
   * Strategy:

     * Do compute (schemas/resolve/init) in one internal batch.
     * Store results in the baton.
     * **Only after** the batch, fire one UI‑facing update on the bus (`…:ui:view:render`) or call the panel’s `on…` callback.
   * Expectation: collapsing multiple render triggers to one often saves **20–40 ms** on “Init/Render” paths (and stabilizes jitter).

3. **Memoize **schemas/resolvers** across remounts**

   * `control:panel:ui:schemas:load` shows up on **every** init (\~30 ms each, 6 runs).
   * Cache by **manifest hash + version**; warm the cache once per app session.
   * Expectation: turn repeat loads into **\~1–3 ms** (lookup), saving **\~25–30 ms per init**.

4. **Subscription hygiene under StrictMode**

   * `…:observers:register` at \~30 ms x6 hints at repeated registration. Ensure the idempotent guards are in place for the Control Panel path and that teardown happens on unmount.
   * Expectation: drop redundant work by **\~30 ms per duplicate** registration.

5. **Slim your hot‑path telemetry**

   * Keep structured logs, but for high‑frequency beats switch to:

     * **Sampled** baton diffs (e.g., 1 in 5) or
     * **Deferred/async** write (queue + microtask) and
     * **Field‑filtered** diffs (only keys that changed).
   * Expectation: **1–3 ms** off light beats, less GC pressure.

6. **Prefer “immediate” or “next‑measure” timing to avoid layout thrash**

   * If two beats both touch state/UI, make the first **compute‑only** and the second the **sole render** trigger. Or mark the first as “after‑beat” and the second as “immediate” to ensure the renderer only sees one consolidated change.
   * Expectation: removes extra 16.6 ms (one frame) stalls in some paths.

7. **Micro‑benchmark to pin down bus+conductor overhead**

   * Add a test sequence with 10 **no‑op** handlers:

     * One variant as **10 beats**
     * One as **1 beat + 9 internal sub‑calls**
   * Compare: average per‑beat envelope vs. per‑sub‑call time; that gives you your real plumbing overhead to tune sampling/telemetry.

# Where to focus first (using your data)

* **Control Panel UI Init** (≈148 ms): collapse 5 beats → 1 beat + iterator; memoize `schemas:load`; register observers once; emit **one** `…:ui:ready` at the end.
  Rough savings: **(3–5 ms × 4) + 25–30 ms + (redundant register?)** ≈ **\~37–50 ms** per init (**25–34%** faster), plus render coalescing wins.
* **UI Render** (≈101 ms): ensure only one render‑triggering beat; push any derivations into the pre‑render batch; consider deferring non‑critical work with “next‑measure”.
* **Canvas Drag/Update** (\~65 ms): check if you’re emitting multiple beats per drag tick; batch payload transforms and only notify UI at a fixed rate (e.g., rAF throttling or every N ms).

# A safe implementation pattern for the iterator

* New handler type: `movement(handler[])`
* Runtime:

  1. Conductor emits `movement:start` (one beat, fully traced).
  2. Iterator runs sub‑handlers **synchronously/awaited** and records `subBeats` with start/stop timestamps and exceptions (in the baton’s `_musicalContext`).
  3. Conductor emits `movement:complete` (optional) with a **summary**, not N separate bus emits.
* Replay:

  * Default: step the entire movement.
  * “Verbose replay” option: step through subBeats.

# Quick answers to your questions

* **“Emit a beat vs direct call”**: the bus+conductor wrapper likely costs **\~1–5 ms/beat**. Your \~30 ms floor is mostly handler/render work. So swapping to direct calls helps a little; **reducing beats and renders helps a lot**.
* **“New iterator that emits only the first movement beat”**: do it on hot paths. Keep subbeat telemetry so you don’t lose traceability/replay. Expect **\~8–14%** sequence speed‑ups from plumbing alone on 5‑beat movements, more with render coalescing/memoization.

If you want, I can turn this into a small checklist PR for the Control Panel Init path (iterator + memoization + single render trigger) and add the no‑op benchmark to lock in the real overhead number for your repo.

Here’s a pragmatic sequencing strategy that gives you the biggest perf win with the least surface-area change, plus how to estimate savings.

# 1) Batch at **movement** granularity (sub‑beats)

Today every beat hits the bus. That’s great for traceability but expensive during hot paths (drag, resize). Add a “local iterator” that runs a contiguous set of beats synchronously and only emits lifecycle events at the **movement** boundary.

**Concept**

* `beat.visibility: "internal" | "public"` (default `public`)
* Internal beats execute via a **local dispatcher** (direct calls), not the global bus.
* The conductor still logs per‑beat telemetry, but it **buffers** it and flushes once at movement end.
* Only the first beat of a movement is announced on the bus (e.g., `movement-started`), and the movement completion is emitted after the sub‑beats finish (`movement-completed`).

**API sketch**

```ts
conductor.play(pluginId, sequenceId, context, {
  batching: {
    groupBy: "movement",            // or "custom"
    emit: "boundary",               // emit lifecycle at movement boundaries only
    bufferTelemetry: true,          // buffer per-beat logs
  }
});
```

**Sequence hinting (opt‑in, per beat)**

```ts
beats: [
  { beat: 1, event: "drag:calc", handler: "calc", visibility: "internal" },
  { beat: 2, event: "drag:layout", handler: "layout", visibility: "internal" },
  { beat: 3, event: "drag:notify", handler: "notify", visibility: "public" } // boundary
]
```

# 2) Use a **frame-gated** scheduler for hot paths

During drag you’re already throttling via rAF, but nested `play()` to refresh the Control Panel can still create extra traffic.

* Add a **frame gate** on `play()` for a set of sequence IDs: calls within a frame coalesce to one execution with the **latest baton**.
* Propagate a **priority**: `CHAINED` work runs within the same frame; `NORMAL` waits for next frame; `LOW` can use `requestIdleCallback` when available.

```ts
conductor.configure({
  frameGate: {
    sequences: ["canvas-drag", "cp-update"],
    coalesce: "latest",             // keep latest payload
    maxPerFrame: 1
  }
});
```

# 3) Make Control Panel updates **diff‑based** and **post‑movement**

Instead of `play()`‑ing the CP on every drag micro‑step, have the drag movement **accumulate** a baton diff (e.g., last position, dirty fields), and only call the CP **once** at:

* end of the movement, or
* next animation frame (whichever comes first), or
* when a “public” boundary beat is reached.

This cuts UI churn dramatically while keeping the UI “fresh enough”.

# 4) Keep traceability without the chatter

You don’t have to give up observability:

* Buffer per‑beat telemetry in an in‑memory ring buffer during sub‑beats.
* Flush a single structured record at `movement-completed` that contains:

  * per‑beat timings
  * baton diffs (summarized)
  * handler outcomes/errors
* Add a **trace level** knob: `full | summary | off` per sequence.

# 5) Fast path for handlers (micro‑overheads)

Micro-optimizations that add up when you’re in the 16.7ms/frame budget:

* Prebind handlers (no `.bind`/closure allocs per beat).
* Reuse baton objects (object pool) to reduce GC in drag streams.
* Avoid JSON stringify in the hot path; log references + snapshots only at boundaries.
* Prefer `Map`/arrays over object scans for handler lookup.

# 6) Concrete savings: how to estimate quickly

Numbers vary by runtime, but you can **measure in your app** in minutes:

**A. Baseline micro-bench (one tab, production build)**

* Loop 10k times:

  * direct handler call (`fn(payload)`).
  * event bus emit → route → handler.
* Warm up first; record median per op via `performance.now()`.

You’ll typically see something like:

* Direct call: \~O(10–50µs) per 100 calls (effectively \~0.1–0.5µs each on modern desktop)
* Bus emit + routing + listener closure: often **an order of magnitude** more when logging, routing tables, and listeners are involved.

**B. Scenario bench (drag)**

* Run a 2‑second scripted drag:

  * current mode (every beat on bus)
  * movement‑batched mode (internal sub‑beats)
* Compare:

  * beats/second emitted to bus
  * GC pauses
  * average/95th frame time
  * CP update count per second

**Rule of thumb**
If a drag movement has 3–5 internal beats that used to each emit, batching at movement‑level typically cuts bus traffic by **3–5×** and logging I/O by **\~70–90%**. Frame‑gating plus diffed CP updates usually shaves another **20–40%** of frame work in hot paths. Combined, it’s common to see **>2×** improvement in p95 frame time on mid‑range machines.

# 7) Migration plan (safe & incremental)

1. **Add the iterator + visibility flag** behind a feature toggle.
2. Convert the noisiest sequences (drag/resize/selection) to mark internal beats.
3. Turn on **frameGate** for those sequences.
4. Switch CP to **diff + boundary‑only** updates.
5. Tighten logs: set `trace: "summary"` for hot paths; keep `full` for rare flows.
6. Watch your telemetry for:

   * event bus emits/second
   * movement duration distribution (avg, p95, p99)
   * frame drops during interactions
   * memory/GC during long drags

# 8) Gotchas to avoid

* Don’t hide **externally-visible** beats: anything other plugins must observe should stay `public`.
* Preserve **ordering guarantees** within the local iterator; if your bus had async semantics, ensure local runs still match expected sequence timing (use your existing “timing” modes).
* Keep **error boundaries**: if a sub‑beat throws, surface it on the movement boundary event with per‑beat context for debugging.

---

If you want, I can draft the minimal patches:

* `SequenceOrchestrator.runMovement()` with a local dispatcher + telemetry buffer.
* `visibility` parsing + defaults.
* `frameGate` coalescer.
* A tiny benchmark harness you can run in the repo to get your own deltas.

Here’s a clean split that lines up with the thin-shell + plugin orchestration direction and keeps you fast, testable, and observable.

# Ownership model

**Ultra-thin client (App shell & PanelSlot) – “initiate, don’t orchestrate.”**

* Triggers flows via `conductor.play(...)` and handles results via explicit callbacks; avoids broad subscriptions. That’s the whole job. &#x20;

**Plugins (your orchestration layer) – “declare intent & chaining.”**

* Define sequences/movements/beats and supply the handlers.
* Express *logical* chaining (what comes after what) by declaring beats/movements and by calling `context.conductor.play(...)` from handlers when you need cross-sequence chaining.
* Keep handlers small, pure where possible, and use the Data Baton for cumulative state across beats. &#x20;

**Conductor (engine) – “own execution, timing, batching, and prebinding.”**

* Enforces SPA rules (no direct EventBus), injects context, and executes beats with timing/priority semantics.
* Provides the primitives for frequency control (e.g., `immediate`, `after-beat`, `next-measure`, `delayed`, `wait-for-signal`) and should own any *batching/sub-beat* mechanism so it’s consistent and observable. &#x20;
* Prebinds: at sequence registration time, the conductor should resolve handler names to function refs, freeze a “movement plan,” and cache invoke wrappers so runtime doesn’t pay string-lookup/shape-checking costs per beat. (This aligns with the conductor’s role as the sequence execution engine.)&#x20;

# Where “sub-beats / batching / prebinding” live

**Chaining (what to run next)** → **Plugin**

* You express chaining by structure (beats in movements) and by `context.conductor.play(...)` for cross-sequence hops. The plugin owns the *intent* and order. &#x20;

**Prebinding & dispatch tables (how to invoke quickly)** → **Conductor**

* During registration, the conductor builds a dispatch table (beat → bound handler) and captures the stable invoke closure that injects context/Data Baton, so execution is a straight function call at runtime. (You already centralize execution in the `SequenceOrchestrator`.)&#x20;

**Batching / sub-beats (how to coalesce work)** → **Conductor provides the primitive; plugin chooses the boundary.**

* Add an engine-level API such as:

  * `conductor.transaction(fn, { timing: 'next-measure' | 'after-beat' })`
  * or `conductor.playBatch(pluginId, sequenceId, beats[], options)`
    The *engine* guarantees single telemetry envelope, correlation, and one “visible” beat on the bus, while running a prebound micro-pipeline internally. The *plugin* decides *when* to open/flush a batch (e.g., drag frame vs. drag end). This keeps the shell simple and the behavior observable. &#x20;

# Why this split works

* **Thin shell stays thin**: it just mounts plugin UIs and calls `play(...)`.&#x20;
* **Plugins remain declarative**: sequences + handlers describe the *what*; cross-sequence links use `play(...)`. &#x20;
* **Engine owns performance & guardrails**: SPAValidator ensures plugins don’t bypass the engine; the engine can optimize dispatch, batching, and timing without changing plugin code.&#x20;

# Practical next steps (minimal changes, maximum win)

1. **Prebinding at registration (engine)**

   * On `register(...)`, resolve handler strings to functions and pre-assemble a `movementPlan[]`. Cache these by sequence signature.&#x20;

2. **Introduce an internal batching primitive (engine)**

   * Start with `conductor.transaction(() => { /* run sub-beats */ }, { timing: 'next-measure' })`.
   * Emit one outer “beat-started/completed” pair; log sub-steps as *micro-beats* inside the same correlation for traceability. (Keeps your logs and Data Baton diffs clean.)&#x20;

3. **Adopt batching boundaries in high-frequency flows (plugins)**

   * For drag: open a transaction at drag-start, apply `updateSize` micro-steps per rAF tick, flush/close at drag-end; forward a single CP refresh at end (or every N frames). Your current resize/forward pattern is a good candidate.&#x20;

4. **Keep the shell callback-first**

   * Panel UIs continue to `play(...)` and receive `on…` callbacks; no change needed.&#x20;
