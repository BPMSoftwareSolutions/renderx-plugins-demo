# Adding a New Topic (Example: SVG Node Update)

This guide shows the end-to-end steps to introduce a new event topic into the system. We use the recently added `canvas.component.update.svg-node.requested` topic as the concrete example.

---
## 1. Pick the Topic Naming
Use the pattern: `<domain>.<component>.<action>[.<sub-scope>].<phase>`

Example: `canvas.component.update.svg-node.requested`
- `canvas.component` – domain + component family
- `update` – high-level action
- `svg-node` – sub-scope (specialization)
- `requested` – phase (initiated by UI / user intent)

Keep names short, specific, and consistent with existing topics.

---
## 2. Decide Interaction vs. Topic
A topic that triggers a sequence must have a corresponding interaction route (`interaction-manifest.json` / `json-interactions/*`). Notify-only topics (no sequence) keep `routes: []`.

`canvas.component.update.svg-node.requested` triggers logic (update + refresh) so it needs:
- A sequence JSON
- A handlers file exporting the functions used by beats
- A route entry mapping the interaction key to the sequence id

---
## 3. Add the Sequence JSON
File: `json-sequences/canvas-component/update.svg-node.json`
Defines beats:
1. Update attribute (`updateSvgNodeAttribute`)
2. Refresh Control Panel (`refreshControlPanel`)

Register it in `json-sequences/canvas-component/index.json`:
```json
{
  "file": "update.svg-node.json",
  "handlersPath": "/plugins/canvas-component/symphonies/update/update.svg-node.symphony.ts"
}
```

---
## 4. Export Handlers
File already existed: `plugins/canvas-component/symphonies/update/update.svg-node.symphony.ts`
Exports:
```ts
export const handlers = { updateSvgNodeAttribute, refreshControlPanel };
```

---
## 5. Register Interaction Route
Add to both manifests:
- `interaction-manifest.json`
- `json-interactions/canvas-component.json`

Key: `canvas.component.update.svg-node` → sequence `canvas-component-update-svg-node-symphony` and plugin `CanvasComponentSvgNodeUpdatePlugin`.

Note: The interaction key omits the trailing `.requested` phase. That suffix lives only in the topic name.

---
## 6. Define Topic in Topics Manifests
Add to:
- Root `topics-manifest.json`
- Component-scoped `json-components/json-topics/canvas-component.json`

Schema used:
```json
{
  "routes": [{ "pluginId": "CanvasComponentSvgNodeUpdatePlugin", "sequenceId": "canvas-component-update-svg-node-symphony" }],
  "payloadSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "id": { "type": "string" },
      "path": { "type": "string" },
      "attribute": { "type": "string" },
      "value": {}
    },
    "required": ["id", "path", "attribute"]
  },
  "visibility": "public",
  "notes": "Update an attribute on an SVG sub-node within a canvas component; routes to SVG node update sequence."
}
```

---
## 7. Update ESLint Topic Rule (If Needed)
If the new topic key is missing during development you'll see: `Unknown topic: <key>` from the runtime or ESLint rule `topics-keys`. Ensure the topic is added before publishing in code.

---
## 8. Use the Topic in Code
`SvgNodeInspector` publishes:
```ts
await EventRouter.publish("canvas.component.update.svg-node.requested", { id, path, attribute, value }, conductor);
```

Publishing requires the topic to exist in the manifest; otherwise the runtime throws `Unknown topic`.

---
## 9. (Optional) Add Tests
Create or extend tests under `__tests__` to cover:
- Successful publish → handlers run
- Validation of payload (missing fields)
- Security / whitelist behavior (as in `svg-node-update.spec.ts`)

---
## 10. Security / Whitelisting
All attribute changes must pass a whitelist (`ALLOWED_SVG_ATTRIBUTES`) inside `update.svg-node.stage-crew.ts`. Extend this set when supporting new attributes.

---
## 11. Checklist Summary
- [x] Sequence JSON created
- [x] Sequence registered in index
- [x] Handlers exported
- [x] Interaction route added
- [x] Topic added to root topics manifest
- [x] Topic added to component topics manifest
- [x] Code publishing the topic updated / created
- [x] Tests reference (or added)
- [x] Docs updated (this file + `svg-node-selection.md` reference already existed)

---
## 12. Common Pitfalls
| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `Unknown topic` error | Topic not in `topics-manifest.json` (or cached build) | Add entry + restart dev server |
| Sequence not firing | Interaction route missing | Add key to `interaction-manifest.json` & `json-interactions/*` |
| Handler not found | Missing export name mismatch | Ensure handler id matches sequence JSON `handler` string |
| Attribute silently ignored | Not in whitelist | Extend `ALLOWED_SVG_ATTRIBUTES` |

---
## 13. Adding Another New Topic (Template)
1. Name: `domain.component.action[.scope].phase`
2. Sequence JSON (if routed) + register in index
3. Handlers file export
4. Interaction route (without phase suffix)
5. Topics manifest entries (root + component-specific)
6. Publish via `EventRouter.publish(<topic>, payload, conductor)`
7. Add tests & docs

Copy the SVG node update as a working reference.

---
## 14. Verification Steps After Adding
1. Restart dev server (ensures fresh manifests load)
2. Run `npm run lint` (eslint rule should pass) 
3. Run focused tests if added (e.g. `npm test -- svg-node-update`)
4. Manually trigger the UI action and watch console for errors
