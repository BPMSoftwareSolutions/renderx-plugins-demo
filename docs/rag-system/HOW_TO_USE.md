## Step-by-Step: Creating the GitHub Issue

### Step 1: Prepare
1. Read `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (5 min)
2. Review `IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` (15 min)
3. Skim `TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md` (10 min)

### Step 2: Create Epic Issue
1. Open GitHub Issues
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Copy content from `GITHUB_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md`
4. Customize:
   - Title: Keep as-is or adjust
   - Description: Adjust based on your context
   - Timeline: Confirm 8 weeks is acceptable
   - Success Criteria: Adjust if needed
5. Add labels: feature, ai, component-generation, vector-store, rag, architecture, epic
6. Link to issue #351
7. Create issue

### Step 3: Create Sub-Issues
For each phase (7-11), create a sub-issue:

**Phase 7 Sub-Issue:**
```
Title: Phase 7 - Template Discovery & Synthesis
Description:
Implement template discovery and synthesis to avoid LLM calls for existing components.

Tasks:
- [ ] Exact match detection service
- [ ] Semantic search with ranking
- [ ] Template synthesis engine
- [ ] Pattern extraction system

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Exact match detection working
- [ ] Semantic search with ranking implemented
- [ ] Template synthesis engine functional
- [ ] Pattern extraction working on real components
- [ ] All tests passing (>90% coverage)

Related: [Link to epic issue]
```

Repeat for Phases 8-11 with appropriate tasks and acceptance criteria.

### Step 4: Link Issues
1. In epic issue, add links to all sub-issues
2. In each sub-issue, link back to epic
3. Link to issue #351 (Phase 1-6)

## Common Questions

### Q: Can we parallelize phases?
**A:** Phases 7-8 can be done in parallel (different developers). Phases 9-11 depend on earlier phases.

### Q: What if we need to accelerate?
**A:** Combine Phases 8-9 (2 weeks) and Phases 10-11 (2 weeks) = 6 weeks total. Requires more resources.

### Q: What if we need to defer some work?
**A:** Phases 7-10 are core. Phase 11 (production framework) can be deferred to Phase 12.

### Q: How do we handle LLM integration?
**A:** Use mocks in tests. Real LLM integration happens in Phase 8 context building.

### Q: What about backwards compatibility?
**A:** All changes are additive. Existing `AIComponentGenerator` remains unchanged.

### Q: How do we measure success?
**A:** Use metrics in `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`. Track weekly.
