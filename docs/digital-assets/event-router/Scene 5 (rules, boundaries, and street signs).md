Perfect — here’s the natural-language breakdown for **Scene 5** (rules, boundaries, and street signs):

---

**Background sky**
The sky remains bright and blue with a few light clouds, keeping the same cheerful daytime atmosphere across the whole journey.

**Road**
The dark asphalt road continues across the bottom third of the scene with a dashed yellow center line. Low guardrails run along the top and bottom edges of the road, reinforcing the idea of safety and enforced limits.

**Bus**
The gold school bus is driving steadily along the road, clearly inside its lane. At this point in the story, the bus is cruising — not stopping — but interacting with the environment’s rules.

**Street signs (rules and diagnostics)**
Several different signs line the roadside, each representing a type of guardrail or safety mechanism in the system:

* A **warning sign with a loop symbol** crossed out, labeled *“Loop Prevention”* — for avoiding infinite publish cycles.
* A **sign with a lab flask icon**, labeled *“Handler Isolation”* — for ensuring event handlers are safe and don’t interfere with one another.
* A **toggle-style sign** with ON/OFF positions, labeled *“Feature Flags”* — for controlling whether certain behaviors are enabled.

These are drawn like real roadside signs: some triangular warning signs, some square or rectangular instructional signs.

**Lane markings for perf controls**
The road itself shows special lane markings to illustrate performance knobs:

* In one lane, a **funnel icon** and a single large pulse mark, symbolizing **debounce** — bursts settle into one.
* In another lane, evenly spaced tick marks or dots, symbolizing **throttle** — events flow at regular intervals.

These markings are painted onto the road, like special instructional stencils.

**Traffic lights (perf cues)**
Further down the road, another traffic light may be seen faintly in the distance, with its red/yellow/green lamps representing the general concept of performance control knobs.

**Caption**
At the bottom of the scene, text explains: *“Street rules: enforced boundaries, flags, throttle & debounce lanes.”* This ties all the signage and markings back to their roles in protecting and shaping event flow.

**Z-order layering**

* Background sky sits behind everything.
* Road and guardrails layer over the ground.
* Signs and traffic lights are positioned along the roadside above the road layer.
* The bus is placed on top of the road layer as the focal moving object.
* Lane markings and symbols are drawn onto the road surface itself.
* Captions and labels float on top for clarity.
