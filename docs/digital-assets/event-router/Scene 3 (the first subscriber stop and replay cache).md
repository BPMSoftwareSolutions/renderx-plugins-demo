Perfect — here’s the natural-language breakdown for **Scene 3** (the first subscriber stop and replay cache):

---

**Background sky**
The sky continues the bright, daytime theme with light blue filling the upper half of the frame and a few scattered, white clouds for continuity and liveliness.

**Road**
The dark-gray asphalt road stretches left to right across the bottom third of the scene. Its dashed yellow center line shows the forward direction, and low guardrails hug the edges, reinforcing safety and order.

**Bus**
The same gold school bus from previous scenes is further along the route, approaching its first stop. The headlight glows, wheels roll, and the bus looks like it’s slowing as it nears the shelter.

**Bus stop (subscriber shelter)**
On the right side of the road is a simple, small shelter with a roof and two benches inside. The benches are labeled as **Bench A: Live Subscriber** and **Bench B: Late Subscriber.** These symbolize the two types of subscribers: ones that were waiting and received the message in real time, and ones who arrive later.

**Replay cache kiosk**
Behind or beside the shelter is a small kiosk or booth labeled **Replay Cache.** It’s drawn like a vending machine or small cabinet, holding a box of “last message.” This illustrates that when late subscribers arrive, they don’t miss out — they immediately receive the most recent payload.

**Arrows and flows**
Visual arrows connect the bus to the live subscriber bench, showing direct delivery. Another arrow flows from the replay cache to the late subscriber bench, highlighting that latecomers are hydrated from stored state.

**Caption**
At the bottom of the scene, text explains the analogy: *“First stop: live & late subscribers; Replay Cache hydrates latecomers.”*

**Z-order layering**

* Sky and clouds sit in the far background.
* Road and guardrails overlay the ground.
* The shelter and replay cache kiosk are roadside, placed on top of the road layer.
* The bus is in the foreground, drawn above shelter elements to keep it as the focal point.
* Flow arrows and explanatory labels are layered last, so they remain clear and readable.
