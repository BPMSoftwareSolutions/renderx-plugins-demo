**Overall header bar**
A wide, horizontal bar pinned to the top of the canvas. It has a soft sky-blue background to tie into the “daytime bus route” theme. Along its bottom edge runs a faint divider line that separates the header from the scenes below.

**Left side — Title with bus icon**
On the far left sits the project title in bold, dark-blue text: *“Tiny Pub/Sub Bus — School Route Story.”* Just before the text, a small golden school bus illustration acts as the visual anchor. The bus looks like the same one that appears in the story scenes: gold body, orange stripe, dark windows, black wheels, and a lit headlight. Beneath the title is a smaller subtitle line in grayish blue: *“A visual analogy for EventRouter routing, perf, and orchestration.”*

**Center — Tabs**
Across the middle are rounded, pill-shaped tabs, like navigation buttons in a toolbar. The first tab says *“All Scenes”* and is filled in bright blue with white text to show it’s the active one. To its right, six more tabs are outlined in blue with white backgrounds, each labeled *“Scene 1”* through *“Scene 6.”* Their text is dark blue. Together, the tabs form a clear, segmented strip for moving between sections of the story.

**Right side — Legend**
On the far right, there’s a small column labeled *“Legend.”* Underneath are four little icon-and-label pairs, explaining the visual metaphors used in the scenes:

* A miniature gold bus with wheels and windows, labeled *“bus = publish.”*
* A tiny bus stop shelter in blue and white, labeled *“stops = subscribers.”*
* A circular hub with a baton drawn diagonally across it, labeled *“hub = conductor.”*
* A vertical traffic light with red, yellow, and green lamps, labeled *“lights = perf.”*

The legend reads like a map key, showing viewers how to interpret the repeating symbols in the journey scenes.
