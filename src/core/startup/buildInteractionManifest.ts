// Placeholder for build-time manifest orchestration
// Per Phase C target structure, this module represents the canonical place
// for manifest build/integrity logic within the core/startup subtree.
//
// Current implementation uses scripts/generate-*.js invoked by npm scripts during
// `npm run build`. We keep this file to align structure and provide a future
// home for TypeScript-based startup orchestration if/when we migrate the build
// scripts into src/core.

// Intentionally no exports for now.
