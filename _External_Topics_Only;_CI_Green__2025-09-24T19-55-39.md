[ ] NAME:Current Task List DESCRIPTION:Root task for conversation __NEW_AGENT__
-[x] NAME:Review Issue Description DESCRIPTION:review the body of the issue: Remove internal json-topics; generate topics-manifest only from plugin-served sequences #238. 
https://github.com/BPMSoftwareSolutions/renderx-plugins-demo/issues/238
-[x] NAME:Review Lessons Learned from Previous Attempt DESCRIPTION:review the most recent comment and lessons learned
-[x] NAME:Create a branch for the second attempt DESCRIPTION:create a branch
-[/] NAME:Implement code changes DESCRIPTION:complete steps 1 through 3 from body of the issue while being mindful of the lessons learned in the comment runing CI locally ("npm run ci") between each step and get tests green before moving to next step
--[x] NAME:Step 1: Generation changes (external-only topics) with CI green DESCRIPTION:Modify generation to rely solely on plugin-served sequences; include notify-only topics required by runtime (e.g., control.panel.selection.updated, canvas.component.drag.move). Run full CI locally and ensure green.
--[ ] NAME:Step 2: Validation/guardrails for topics manifest DESCRIPTION:Add unit tests to assert expected notify-only topics are present and that unknown topic publishes fail fast. Keep to TDD: write failing test, implement, make green.
--[ ] NAME:Step 3: Cleanup and docs/ADR DESCRIPTION:Remove any remaining local json-topics; update docs/ADR to document external-only topic derivation and guardrails; ensure repo reflects thin-host architecture.
--[x] NAME:Review .logs for library-drop.cy DESCRIPTION:Inspect .logs/library-drop-*.log to validate errors are resolved and to capture insights for tests/guardrails.
--[x] NAME:Between Step 1 → Step 2: Push changes to branch DESCRIPTION:After Step 1 CI is green locally, push the branch to remote. Do not include generated artifacts or videos.
--[x] NAME:Between Step 1 → Step 2: Wait 2 minutes (CLI timer) DESCRIPTION:Run a CLI timer (Start-Sleep -Seconds 120) to give remote CI time to start/complete.
--[/] NAME:Between Step 1 → Step 2: Check remote CI run and verify green DESCRIPTION:Check the remote CI job status for the last push and verify it passed.
--[ ] NAME:Between Step 1 → Step 2: Address any remote CI failures until green DESCRIPTION:If remote CI failed, iterate on fixes, push, and re-verify until green.
--[ ] NAME:Between Step 2 → Step 3: Push changes to branch DESCRIPTION:After Step 2 CI is green locally, push the branch to remote. Do not include generated artifacts or videos.
