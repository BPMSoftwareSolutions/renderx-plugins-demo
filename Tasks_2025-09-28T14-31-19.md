[x] NAME:Current Task List DESCRIPTION:All subtasks completed: SVGs reviewed, integration example reviewed, mapping created, unit test added (TDD), integrated SVG created, tests passing.
-[x] NAME:Review SVG files DESCRIPTION:Reviewed yellow_school_bus-driving-thru.svg (viewBox 400x200, bus animate translate -365→1000 over 20s; wheel centers at (310,155) and (110,155) with radius 20) and school_bus_depot.svg (viewBox 800x400, road at y=250..300, key labels like SCHOOL BUS DEPOT, FUEL, WASH BAY).
-[x] NAME:Review Integration Example DESCRIPTION:Reviewed integration .ui example which overlays two SVG components with layout positions; bus retains horizontal animate translate; observed depot layout 746x406 at (459,334) and bus 735x225 at (463,440).
-[x] NAME:Create coordinate mapping DESCRIPTION:Created docs/digital-assets/bus_depot.mapping.json documenting depot/bus viewBoxes, road band, bus wheel geometry, horizontal path, and vertical alignment (translateY=125), with output file details.
-[x] NAME:Create unit test for an integrated SVG DESCRIPTION:Added tests/integrated-bus-depot.spec.ts asserting integrated SVG structure vs mapping; executed Vitest, observed initial failure (missing file), implemented SVG, reran tests to green.
-[x] NAME:Create integrated SVG of Bus Leaving Depot DESCRIPTION:Created docs/digital-assets/integrated_bus_leaving_depot.svg using bus_depot.mapping.json; ensured #depot-layer and #bus-layer with translateY=125 and animateTransform -365→1000/20s; ran unit test to green.
