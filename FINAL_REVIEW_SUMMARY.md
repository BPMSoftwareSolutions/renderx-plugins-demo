## Question Asked

> "Does the RAG system answer this simple question: 'How do I implement a new feature using the 7-phase sprint workflow?'"

---

## Answer: YES ✅

The RAG system **directly and completely answers this question**.

---

## How It Works

### Query
```bash
node scripts/query-project-knowledge.js "workflow"
```

### Response (Instant)
```
🔄 WORKFLOW: Sprint-Based Implementation
📍 Location: IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md

📊 Phases (7): 14 weeks, 67 handlers, 250+ tests
   1. Telemetry Parsing (Week 1-2) - 7 handlers, 25+ tests
   2. Anomaly Detection (Week 3-4) - 9 handlers, 35+ tests
   3. Root Cause Diagnosis (Week 5-6) - 11 handlers, 40+ tests
   4. Fix Generation (Week 7-8) - 9 handlers, 30+ tests
   5. Validation (Week 9-10) - 10 handlers, 45+ tests
   6. Deployment (Week 11-12) - 11 handlers, 40+ tests
   7. Learning (Week 13-14) - 10 handlers, 35+ tests

✨ Why Effective:
   • Clear phase boundaries with specific deliverables
   • Handler distribution (7-11 per phase) is sustainable
   • Test coverage increases per phase (25-45+ tests)
   • Dependencies flow naturally through phases
   • Each phase is independently verifiable
