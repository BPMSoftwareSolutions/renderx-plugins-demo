# üéº MusicalConductor

A sophisticated sequence orchestration engine for managing complex workflows with plugin-based architecture, resource management, and comprehensive monitoring.

## üöÄ Overview

MusicalConductor is a lean, modular orchestration system that coordinates the execution of musical sequences (workflows) with advanced features like resource conflict resolution, React StrictMode handling, and comprehensive plugin management. Originally a 3,228-line monolith, it has been refactored into a clean 736-line coordinator with 20 specialized components.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üéØ Sequence Orchestration**: Execute complex workflows with movement and beat coordination
- **üîå Plugin Architecture**: Dynamic plugin loading with CIA (Conductor Integration Architecture) compliance
- **‚ö° Resource Management**: Advanced resource conflict resolution and ownership tracking
- **üìä Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time statistics, performance tracking, and event logging
- **üõ°Ô∏è StrictMode Protection**: React StrictMode duplicate detection and handling
- **üéΩ Data Baton**: Payload passing between sequence beats for stateful workflows
- **üîÑ Queue Management**: Priority-based sequence execution with conflict resolution
- **üìà Event System**: Contextual event emission with subscriber management

## üß™ Testing (Post‚Äësplit)

This repository now contains only the MusicalConductor core. End‚Äëto‚Äëend (E2E) browser tests live in the RenderX shell repository.

Core tests (here):

- Run all unit tests: `npm test`
- With coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- Filter by file/pattern: `npm test -- tests/unit/communication/`

E2E tests (moved):

- See the RenderX shell repo for Playwright setup and the minimal Chrome smoke test
- Rationale and timeline: tools/docs/wiki/adr/0015-split-renderx-and-plugins.md

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install musical-conductor
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import {
  initializeCommunicationSystem,
  MusicalConductor,
  EventBus
} from "musical-conductor";

// Initialize the communication system
const { eventBus, conductor } = initializeCommunicationSystem();

// Register a sequence
conductor.registerSequence(
  {
    name: "my-sequence",
    movements: [
      {
        name: "initialization",
        beats: [
          { name: "setup", handler: "setupHandler" },
          { name: "validate", handler: "validateHandler" },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    setupHandler: (data, context) => {
      console.log("Setting up...", data);
      return { initialized: true };
    },
    validateHandler: (data, context) => {
      console.log("Validating...", context.payload);
      return { validated: true };
    },
  }
);

// Execute sequence
const executionId = conductor.startSequence("my-sequence", {
  input: "data",
});
```

### Plugin Development

```typescript
// Create a plugin
const myPlugin = {
  sequence: {
    name: "MyPlugin.my-symphony",
    movements: [
      {
        name: "process",
        beats: [{ name: "transform", handler: "transformHandler" }],
      },
    ],
  },
  handlers: {
    transformHandler: (data, context) => {
      // Transform data
      return { transformed: data.input.toUpperCase() };
    },
  },
};

// Mount plugin
conductor.mountPlugin(myPlugin.sequence, myPlugin.handlers, "MyPlugin");
```

## üìä Monitoring & Statistics

```typescript
// Get execution statistics
const stats = conductor.getStatistics();
console.log("Sequences executed:", stats.sequencesExecuted);
console.log("Average execution time:", stats.averageExecutionTime);

// Get current status
const status = conductor.getStatus();
console.log("Active sequences:", status.statistics.activeSequences);
console.log("Queue size:", status.statistics.queueSize);

// Monitor events
conductor.subscribe("sequence-completed", (event) => {
  console.log("Sequence completed:", event.sequenceName);
});
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Resource Management

```typescript
// Sequences automatically handle resource conflicts
conductor.startSequence("resource-intensive-sequence", {
  resourceId: "shared-resource",
  priority: "HIGH", // Will interrupt lower priority sequences
});

// Check resource ownership
const ownership = conductor.getResourceOwnership();
console.log("Current resource owners:", ownership);
```

## üéΩ Data Baton (Payload Passing)

```typescript
// Handlers can access and modify the data baton
const handlers = {
  firstBeat: (data, context) => {
    // Add to payload for next beats
    context.payload.processedData = data.input.processed;
    return { step1: "complete" };
  },
  secondBeat: (data, context) => {
    // Access payload from previous beats
    const processed = context.payload.processedData;
    return { step2: "complete", used: processed };
  },
};
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npm test -- tests/unit/communication/sequences/MusicalConductor.simple.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests (requires setup)
npm run test:e2e
```

### E2E Testing with Playwright

The project includes comprehensive E2E tests that validate MusicalConductor in real browser environments using the package from Git repository:

```bash
# Navigate to E2E tests directory
cd e2e-tests

# One-command setup and run
npm run setup && npm test

# Or step by step
npm install                 # Install dependencies
npm run test:install       # Install Playwright browsers
npm test                   # Run E2E tests
npm run test:headed        # Run with visible browser
npm run test:debug         # Run in debug mode
```

**E2E Test Coverage:**

- ‚úÖ Package installation from Git repository
- ‚úÖ React SPA integration in real browsers
- ‚úÖ Time-date stamped console logging
- ‚úÖ Plugin validation and SPA compliance
- ‚úÖ Architectural boundary enforcement

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the modular architecture patterns
- Maintain 100% test coverage
- Use proper TypeScript types
- Follow the delegation patterns established
- Update documentation for new features

## üìù API Reference

### Core Methods

- `startSequence(name, data, priority)` - Execute a sequence
- `registerSequence(sequence, handlers, pluginId)` - Register a new sequence
- `mountPlugin(sequence, handlers, pluginId)` - Mount a plugin
- `getStatistics()` - Get execution statistics
- `getStatus()` - Get current conductor status

### Event Types

- `sequence-started` - Sequence execution began
- `sequence-completed` - Sequence finished successfully
- `sequence-failed` - Sequence execution failed
- `beat-executed` - Individual beat completed
- `resource-conflict` - Resource conflict detected

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sequence Not Found**

```
Error: Sequence "my-sequence" not found
```

- Ensure the sequence is registered before execution
- Check plugin loading logs for errors

**Resource Conflicts**

```
Resource conflict: Resource already owned by another sequence
```

- Use appropriate priority levels (HIGH, NORMAL, CHAINED)
- Check resource ownership with `getResourceOwnership()`

**StrictMode Duplicates**

```
StrictMode duplicate detected
```

- This is expected in React development mode
- Duplicates are automatically filtered out

    // Custom logic for handling conflicts
    return requesting.priority > current.priority ? "INTERRUPT" : "QUEUE";
  },
});
```

### Event Filtering

```typescript
// Subscribe to filtered events
conductor.subscribe(
  "sequence-*",

    console.log("Sequence event:", event);
  },
  {
    filter: (event) => event.priority === "HIGH",
  }
);
