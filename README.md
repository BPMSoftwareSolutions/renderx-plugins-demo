# 🎼 MusicalConductor

A sophisticated sequence orchestration engine for managing complex workflows with plugin-based architecture, resource management, and comprehensive monitoring.

## 🚀 Overview

MusicalConductor is an orchestration engine that makes harmony out of chaos. It turns drifting, competing subsystems into a single score—sequencing work into movements and beats with clear signatures, correlation, and telemetry. At scale, it keeps applications and platforms simple on the surface while coordinating complex flows underneath via a minimal client API (conductor.play) and a powerful runtime.

Originally a 3,228-line monolith, the conductor has been refactored into a lean, modular core with specialized components for orchestration, plugin compliance, resource management, and monitoring.

## ✨ Key Features

- Orchestrate via play(): a single, simple client API for complex work
- CIA/SPA compliance: build-time CIA tests, runtime SPA validation and guardrails
- Sequencing: movements and beats with timing, dynamics, and sequence signatures
- Correlation-first: execution IDs threaded end-to-end for traceability
- Data Baton: a shared, logged payload that flows between beats
- Transaction frequency control: timing modes eliminate race conditions (immediate, after-beat, next-measure, delayed, wait-for-signal)
- Resource management: priority, ownership, and conflict resolution

## Why MusicalConductor

- Make harmony: unify many subsystems under one score with clear movements and beats
- Turn chaos into order: eliminate race conditions with timing controls and priorities
- Scale simply: a tiny client surface (play, subscribe) fronts a powerful engine
- Observe everything: correlation IDs, baton diffs, and structured logs for every step

- Telemetry: status, statistics, and structured logs for every beat/sequence

## 🧪 Testing (Post‑split)

This repository now contains only the MusicalConductor core. End‑to‑end (E2E) browser tests live in the RenderX shell repository.

Core tests (here):

- Run all unit tests: `npm test`
- With coverage: `npm run test:coverage`
- Filter by file/pattern: `npm test -- tests/unit/communication/`

E2E tests (moved):

- See the RenderX shell repo for Playwright setup and the minimal Chrome smoke test
- Rationale and timeline: tools/docs/wiki/adr/0015-split-renderx-and-plugins.md

## 🧩 CIA & SPA Architecture

- CIA (Conductor Integration Architecture): defines how plugins are discovered, mounted, and orchestrated. Compliance is enforced at build/test time by unit tests that exercise plugin registration and handler contracts.
- SPA (Symphonic Plugin Architecture): defines how plugins behave at runtime. SPAValidator enforces that plugins do not directly access the EventBus and only orchestrate via conductor.play().

Compliance
- Build-time: CIA unit tests validate sequence shape and handler contracts (see tests/unit/communication and ADR-0004, ADR-0008)
- Runtime: SPAValidator intercepts eventBus.emit/subscribe and raises violations for direct access (ADR-0002)

Handler context (what your handler receives):
```ts
function onSelect(data: any, context: any) {
  // Correlation (request) and musical context travel with the event
  const reqId = data._musicalContext?.execution?.requestId;

  // Data Baton for cross-beat payload
  context.payload.lastSelectedId = data.elementId;

  // Minimal client surface
  context.conductor.play("OtherPlugin", "other-symphony", { parent: reqId }, "CHAINED");
}
```

### Beat Patterns & Sequence Signatures

- Beats: discrete, ordered events with dynamics (priority) and timing (frequency)
- Movements: related groups of beats; a sequence may have multiple movements
- Signatures: give every sequence a clear identity (id, name, category, key, tempo)

Example:
```ts
export const sequence = {
  id: "toast-symphony",
  name: "Toast Symphony",
  key: "G Major",
  tempo: 90,
  category: "system",
  movements: [
    { id: "notify", name: "Notify", beats: [
      { beat: 1, event: "notify:prepare", handler: "prepare", dynamics: "mp", timing: "after-beat" },
      { beat: 2, event: "notify:show", handler: "show", dynamics: "f", timing: "immediate" },
    ]},
  ],
};
```

Apps “discern” beat patterns by subscribing to conductor lifecycle events and by inspecting `_musicalContext` attached to event payloads during execution.


## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install musical-conductor
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { initializeCommunicationSystem, type ConductorClient } from "musical-conductor";

// Initialize the communication system (idempotent; StrictMode-safe)
const { conductor } = initializeCommunicationSystem();

// Optionally load CIA plugins declared in your plugin manifest
await conductor.registerCIAPlugins();

// Orchestrate via CIA: play(pluginId, sequenceId, context?, priority?)
conductor.play(
  "MyPlugin",                  // pluginId
  "component-select-symphony", // sequenceId (declared by the plugin)
  {
    elementId: "rx-comp-123",
    onSelectionChange: (id: string | null) => console.log("Selected:", id),
  },
  "HIGH"                        // optional priority: HIGH | NORMAL | CHAINED
);
```

### Plugin Development

```typescript
// In your plugin module (e.g., /plugins/MyPlugin/index.ts)
export const sequence = {
  id: "component-select-symphony",
  name: "Component Select Symphony",
  key: "C Major",
  tempo: 120,
  category: "component-ui",
  movements: [
    {
      id: "process",
      name: "Process",
      beats: [
        { beat: 1, event: "component:select", handler: "onSelect", dynamics: "mf", timing: "immediate" },
      ],
    },
  ],
};

export const handlers = {
  onSelect(data: any, context: any) {
    // Data Baton: enrich payload for later beats
    context.payload.lastSelectedId = data.elementId;

    // Orchestrate other work via play()
    context.conductor.play("NotificationPlugin", "toast-symphony", {
      message: `Selected ${data.elementId}`,
    }, "CHAINED");

    return { selected: true };
  },
};
```

At runtime, the Conductor loads and mounts SPA plugins via CIA manifests:

```typescript
import { initializeCommunicationSystem } from "musical-conductor";

const { conductor } = initializeCommunicationSystem();
await conductor.registerCIAPlugins(); // Loads /plugins/plugin-manifest.json

// Later, simply play your plugin’s sequences
conductor.play("MyPlugin", "component-select-symphony", { elementId: "rx-comp-123" });
```

## 📊 Telemetry & Monitoring

```typescript
// Read-only analytics
const stats = conductor.getStatistics();
console.log("Total sequences executed:", stats.totalSequencesExecuted);
console.log("Average execution time (ms):", stats.averageExecutionTime);

// Status snapshot with warnings and summaries
const status = conductor.getStatus();
console.log("Mounted plugins:", status.statistics.mountedPlugins);
console.log("Queue length:", status.statistics.currentQueueLength);

// Subscribe to lifecycle events
conductor.subscribe("sequence-completed", (evt) => {
  console.log("✅ Completed:", evt.sequenceName, "id=", evt.requestId);
});

// Data Baton diffs are logged automatically per beat/handler
// You’ll see 🎽 DataBaton logs with added/removed/updated keys and previews.
```

## 🛡️ Resource Management

```typescript
// Acquire a shared resource by orchestrating the owning sequence
conductor.play("MyPlugin", "resource-intensive-symphony", {
  resourceId: "shared-resource",
}, "HIGH"); // HIGH may interrupt a lower-priority owner

// Conflicts are resolved by the engine; inspect queue/throughput via status
const status = conductor.getStatus();
console.log("Queue length:", status.statistics.currentQueueLength);
```

## 🎽 Data Baton (Payload Passing)

```typescript
// Handlers can access and modify the data baton
const handlers = {
  firstBeat: (data, context) => {
    // Add to payload for next beats
    context.payload.processedData = data.input.processed;
    return { step1: "complete" };
  },
  secondBeat: (data, context) => {
    // Access payload from previous beats
    const processed = context.payload.processedData;
    return { step2: "complete", used: processed };
  },
};
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Unit tests (TDD-friendly)
npm test

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Focus a suite
npm test -- tests/unit/communication/
```

- CIA compliance is enforced by unit tests (sequence/handler contracts)
- SPA compliance is enforced at runtime by SPAValidator (no direct EventBus)
- E2E tests live in the RenderX shell repo per ADR‑0015 (minimal Chrome smoke)

## 📝 API Reference

### Client Surface (ConductorClient)

- `play(pluginId, sequenceId, context?, priority?)` → any
- `subscribe(eventName, callback, context?)` → () => void
- `unsubscribe(eventName, callback)` → void
- `registerCIAPlugins()` → Promise<void>
- `getStatistics()` → ConductorStatistics & { mountedPlugins: number }
- `getStatus()` → { statistics, eventBus: boolean, sequences: number, plugins: number }
- `getSequenceNames()` → string[]
- `getMountedPlugins()` → string[]
- `getMountedPluginIds()` → string[]

Notes:
- Use `play()` for all orchestration; do not call internal `startSequence()` from apps
- Subscribe via `conductor.subscribe()`; do not import or use EventBus directly

### Event Types (common)

- `sequence-started` | `sequence-completed` | `sequence-failed`
- `beat-started` | `beat-completed` | `beat-failed`
- `musical-conductor:log` (structured logs)
- Resource diagnostics available via internal APIs (for tests/tools)


## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sequence Not Found**

```
Error: Sequence "my-sequence" not found
```

- Ensure the sequence is registered before execution
- Check plugin loading logs for errors

**Resource Conflicts**

```
Resource conflict: Resource already owned by another sequence
```

- Use appropriate priority levels (HIGH, NORMAL, CHAINED)
- Check resource ownership with `getResourceOwnership()`

**StrictMode Duplicates**

```
StrictMode duplicate detected
```

- This is expected in React development mode
- Duplicates are automatically filtered out
