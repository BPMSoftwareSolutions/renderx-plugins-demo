# 🤖 Add AI-Powered Component Generator with OpenAI

## 📝 Summary
Add an AI chatbot to the Component Library that generates custom components from natural language descriptions using OpenAI's API.

**User Story:** As a user, I want to describe a component in plain English and have it automatically generated so that I can create components without knowing JSON syntax.

**Example Flow:**
```
User: "Create a blue button with rounded corners and a hover effect"
AI: [Generates valid component JSON]
User: [Clicks "Add to Library"]
→ Component appears in Custom Components category
```

---

## 🎯 Motivation

### Current State
- Users can upload custom components via drag-and-drop JSON files
- Requires knowledge of component schema and JSON syntax
- High barrier for non-technical users

### Desired State
- Users can describe components in natural language
- AI generates valid, ready-to-use components
- Lower barrier to entry, faster prototyping

### Benefits
- **Non-technical users:** Create components without coding
- **Developers:** Rapid prototyping and boilerplate generation
- **Learning:** Generated components serve as examples
- **Consistency:** AI follows schema and best practices

---

## ✨ Features

### 1. Chat Interface
- Toggle button in Library Panel header (🤖 icon)
- Collapsible chat window with message history
- Text input with send button
- Loading indicator during generation
- Message bubbles (user vs AI)

### 2. Component Generation
- Natural language input → OpenAI API → Component JSON
- Validation against existing component schema
- Preview with action buttons:
  - "Add to Library" - Saves to custom components
  - "Edit JSON" - Opens editor modal
  - "Try Again" - Regenerates with feedback
  - "Copy JSON" - Clipboard copy

### 3. API Key Settings
- Settings panel for OpenAI configuration
- API key input (password-masked)
- Model selection (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo)
- Connection validation
- Security warnings

### 4. Conversation Context
- Multi-turn conversations for refinement
- "Make it blue" after initial generation
- Context maintained across messages

### 5. Chat History
- Persist conversations in localStorage
- Load previous chats on open
- Clear history option

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### ⚠️ API Key Storage

**Issue:** localStorage is NOT secure
- Vulnerable to XSS attacks
- Any JavaScript can read it
- No encryption at rest

**MVP Solution (Phase 1):**
- Store in localStorage with Base64 obfuscation
- Display prominent security warnings
- Guide users to set spending limits
- "Clear Key" button for shared devices

**Production Solution (Phase 2):**
- Backend proxy to store API keys securely
- Frontend → Backend → OpenAI
- Centralized billing and rate limiting

**User Warning:**
```
⚠️ SECURITY WARNING
Your API key will be stored in browser storage. This is NOT secure.
Only use API keys with strict spending limits.
Never use this on shared or untrusted devices.
```

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### OpenAI API Pricing (User Pays)

**GPT-4-Turbo:** ~$0.02-0.05 per component
**GPT-3.5-Turbo:** ~$0.002-0.005 per component (10x cheaper)

**Mitigation:**
- Default to GPT-3.5-turbo
- Show token usage in UI
- Recommend spending limits
- Document expected costs
