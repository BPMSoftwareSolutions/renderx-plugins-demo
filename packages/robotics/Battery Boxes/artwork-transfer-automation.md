Automate this with Python:

Emboss/engrave Daniel’s artwork onto a flat vertical face of Kevin’s battery box.
(A) FreeCAD’s headless Python API or (B) CadQuery. 

Below is a practical, “works-on-a-laptop” CadQuery approach that embosses/engraves Daniel’s artwork onto a flat vertical face of Kevin’s battery box.

# Option B (CadQuery): project vector artwork onto Kevin’s box and cut/emboss

**What you need**

* Python 3.10+
* `cadquery` (`pip install cadquery`)
* Daniel’s artwork as **SVG or DXF** (if it only exists inside the STEP, export just the artwork to SVG/DXF once from your CAD tool).
  Files you have:

  * `/mnt/data/Daniels Battery Box.step` (source model)
  * `/mnt/data/Kevin's Battery Box.step` (target model)
  * `/path/to/daniel_art.svg` (or `.dxf`) ← export this once

**Script (save as `apply_artwork.py`)**

```python
import cadquery as cq
from math import isclose

# --- inputs ---
KEVIN_STEP = r"/mnt/data/Kevin's Battery Box.step"
ARTFILE    = r"/path/to/daniel_art.svg"   # or .dxf
ENGRAVE_DEPTH_MM = 0.6                    # negative cuts in, positive embosses out
ART_SCALE = 1.0                           # tweak to size artwork
OFFSET_X, OFFSET_Y = 0.0, 0.0             # mm offsets on the target face

# --- load target (Kevin's box) ---
target = cq.importers.importStep(KEVIN_STEP)

# helper: find a large, *vertical* planar face to place the artwork
def largest_vertical_face(shape: cq.Shape):
    faces = list(shape.faces().vals())
    best = None
    best_area = 0.0
    for f in faces:
        surf = f._faces__geomType()  # internal; or cq.Shape.getPlane() safeguard below
        try:
            pl = f.toPln()  # Workplane plane (fails if not planar)
        except Exception:
            continue
        n = pl.zDir  # face normal
        # vertical means normal is roughly horizontal (Z near 0)
        if isclose(abs(n.z), 0.0, abs_tol=1e-3):
            a = f.Area()
            if a > best_area:
                best, best_area = f, a
    return best

face = largest_vertical_face(target)
if face is None:
    raise RuntimeError("No suitable vertical planar face found to place artwork.")

# make a workplane on that face
wp = cq.Workplane(obj=target).workplane(offset=0, centerOption="CenterOfBoundBox", origin=face)

# import the artwork (SVG recommended for curves; DXF also works)
if ARTFILE.lower().endswith(".svg"):
    art = cq.importers.importSvg(ARTFILE)
else:
    # DXF: returns wires on XY; we’ll use those
    art = cq.importers.importDXF(ARTFILE)

# center and scale the artwork onto the workplane
# convert imported shapes to a single compound of wires
wires = []
for obj in (art if isinstance(art, list) else [art]):
    try:
        for w in obj.wires().vals():
            wires.append(w)
    except Exception:
        pass
if not wires:
    raise RuntimeError("No wires found in the artwork file. Ensure paths are outlines, not images.")

compound = cq.Compound.makeCompound(wires)

# get a bounding box to scale/center
bb = compound.BoundingBox()
sx = ART_SCALE
sy = ART_SCALE
sz = 1.0

# move artwork so its center is at (0,0) before placing
cx = (bb.xmax + bb.xmin) / 2.0
cy = (bb.ymax + bb.ymin) / 2.0
cz = (bb.zmax + bb.zmin) / 2.0
compound = (compound.translate((-cx, -cy, -cz))
                    .scale(sx, sy, sz)
                    .translate((OFFSET_X, OFFSET_Y, 0)))

# place outlines on the target face workplane and make a shallow cut/emboss
# project the artwork onto the face’s plane
proj = wp.add(compound)

# choose cut (engrave) vs add (emboss)
if ENGRAVE_DEPTH_MM < 0:
    result = proj.cutBlind(ENGRAVE_DEPTH_MM)  # negative = into the face
else:
    result = proj.extrude(ENGRAVE_DEPTH_MM)   # positive = raised logo

# export the new part
cq.exporters.export(result, "Kevins_Box_with_Daniels_Artwork.step")
print("✅ Wrote: Kevins_Box_with_Daniels_Artwork.step")
```

**How it works**

* Finds Kevin’s **largest vertical planar face** (good default for “the side”).
* Imports Daniel’s artwork (SVG/DXF), recenters & scales it, then **projects** it onto that face.
* Engraves (negative depth) or embosses (positive depth) by a set amount.
* Writes a new STEP with the artwork applied.

**Tweakables**

* `ENGRAVE_DEPTH_MM`: negative (e.g., `-0.6`) for etched look; positive for raised badge.
* `ART_SCALE`: grow/shrink the logo without having to edit the source file.
* `OFFSET_X, OFFSET_Y`: nudge the placement on the face.
* If you prefer a different face (front/back), swap the face selector to normals near ±X or ±Y.

# Option A (FreeCAD, headless macro)

If you already use FreeCAD, you can do this without opening the GUI:

1. Export Daniel’s logo as **SVG/DXF** (Draft → Shape2DView or TechDraw projection).
2. Run a small macro to:

   * import Kevin’s STEP
   * import the SVG/DXF as Draft wires
   * map to target face with “Map Sketch to Face” logic (via Python)
   * `Part.makeFace` → `makeThickness`/`extrude` → **cut** or **fuse**
3. Export the combined solid to STEP.

This path is great if Daniel’s “artwork” already exists as edges/faces inside his STEP—you can extract just those wires directly in FreeCAD.

## Gotchas / tips

* **Artwork as bitmap (PNG/JPG)?** Vectorize once (e.g., Inkscape “Trace Bitmap”) to SVG, then use the script.
* **Curvy logos** cut cleaner from **SVG** than DXF in many CAD kernels.
* **Non-flat placement** (curved face) is possible but needs surface mapping; the simple script targets **planar** vertical faces.
* If Daniel’s artwork in the STEP is already a raised/recessed **solid**, a variant script can align and boolean that solid onto Kevin’s box instead of projecting outlines—happy to share that version if you want it.
