Feature: cag agent workflow
  In order to audit orchestration domain 'cag-agent-workflow'
  As a governance observer
  I want baseline BDD coverage for 'cag-agent-workflow'

  Scenario: Baseline coverage placeholder for cag-agent-workflow
    Given the orchestration audit system is initialized
    When the 'cag-agent-workflow' sequence executes baseline flow
    Then an audit artifact is produced for 'cag-agent-workflow'
