Here’s a **storyboard summary** in natural language that strings all six scenes together into a continuous narrative, like a comic strip of the bus’s journey:

---

### **Scene 1 – The Depot (Publisher Origin)**

The journey begins at a small depot on the left side of the road. A golden school bus rolls out of the depot and onto the main road. The sky is bright and blue with a few scattered clouds. The road stretches off to the right, bordered by grassy verges. This symbolizes the first act of publishing: the event is created and leaves its origin.
**Caption:** *“Bus leaves depot → publish(topic, payload).”*

---

### **Scene 2 – The Route Map and First Light (Manifest + Debounce)**

As the bus continues down the road, it encounters a tall traffic light with its **yellow lamp glowing**. Next to it is a roadside billboard showing a JSON snippet with `topic`, `routes`, and `perf.debounceMs`. Just past that stands a smaller green street sign reading: *“Logs ▶ routing_to …”*. The bus slows, waiting at the yellow light — the analogy for debounce, letting bursts settle.
**Caption:** *“Manifest plans route; yellow light settles bursts (debounce).”*

---

### **Scene 3 – The First Stop (Subscribers + Replay Cache)**

Further along, the bus arrives at a bus stop shelter. Inside are two benches: one labeled *Live Subscriber* (already waiting) and another labeled *Late Subscriber*. Just behind the shelter stands a small kiosk labeled *Replay Cache,* holding the “last message.” Arrows show direct delivery from the bus to the live subscriber bench, and replay delivery from the cache to the late subscriber bench.
**Caption:** *“First stop: live & late subscribers; Replay Cache hydrates latecomers.”*

### **Scene 4 – The Transfer Hub (Conductor)**

The road leads into a special circular hub, like a central station. In its middle is a conductor’s baton crossed with a musical note, labeled *“Conductor: play().”* Multiple side roads branch away from the hub, each marked with arrows showing new paths. Small figures (“kids”) leave the bus and board other buses at the hub, symbolizing the conductor orchestrating sequences and distributing events into different plugins.
**Caption:** *“Special hub: topics route into sequences via Conductor (plugins).”*

---

### **Scene 5 – The Rules of the Road (Boundaries + Perf Knobs)**

The bus cruises forward under a system of clear boundaries and rules. Guardrails line the road edges. Street signs stand on the roadside: one warns against loops, another shows a flask for handler isolation, and another is a toggle sign for feature flags. Painted onto the road are special lane markings: a funnel with a single pulse (debounce) and evenly spaced ticks (throttle). In the distance, another traffic light reinforces performance control.
**Caption:** *“Street rules: enforced boundaries, flags, throttle & debounce lanes.”*

---

### **Scene 6 – The School (Application State)**

Finally, the road ends at a welcoming school building with a flag waving on its roof. The bus is parked in front, and children step off and head into the entrance. Pennant banners or balloons decorate the scene, creating a sense of arrival. The school represents the application state — the final destination where all the events are delivered safely.
**Caption:** *“Destination reached: application state updated (successful delivery).”*

---

### **Overall Flow**

Together, the six scenes form a clear, continuous story:

1. **Publishing** begins at the depot.
2. **Routing rules and performance controls** guide the journey.
3. **Subscribers** receive messages live or via replay.
4. **Conductor orchestration** splits events into new sequences.
5. **Rules of the road** enforce safe handling.
6. **Final state** is reached at the school.

This summary is like a **comic-strip script**: each scene is a panel, progressing left to right along the same bus route, each adding more depth to the analogy.
