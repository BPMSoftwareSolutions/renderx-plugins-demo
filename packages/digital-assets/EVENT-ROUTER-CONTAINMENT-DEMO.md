- **Boundary**: Yellow theme with performance controls
- **Elements**: Guardrails, warning signs, throttle/debounce lane markings
- **Concept**: Enforced boundaries, feature flags, performance controls
- **Policy**: Comprehensive rule enforcement with visual indicators

### **Scene 6: Final Destination (Application State)** üè´
- **Boundary**: Green theme with completion elements
- **Elements**: School building, parked bus, children disembarking
- **Concept**: Successful event delivery and application state update
- **Policy**: Final containment with celebration elements

## üåä **Animated Flow System**

### **Bus Journey Flow**
- **Path**: `depot-to-manifest > manifest-to-subscribers > subscribers-to-conductor > conductor-to-rules > rules-to-destination`
- **Token**: Golden bus token with trail effect
- **Speed**: 120px/s for smooth motion
- **Activation**: Highlights all 6 boundaries during traversal
- **Loop**: Continuous journey demonstration

### **Connection Architecture**
- **Manhattan Routing**: Clean orthogonal paths between scenes
- **Port-Based Connections**: Precise attachment points on boundary edges
- **Visual Styling**: Dashed lines with scene-specific colors
- **Labels**: Descriptive text for each connection segment

## üé® **Professional Visual Design**

### **Styling Features**
- **Scene Shadows**: Drop shadow filters for depth
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Sky, road, and bus gradients
- **Color Coding**: Each scene has thematic color scheme
- **Typography**: Professional fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Icons**: Emoji and symbols for visual storytelling

### **Boundary Policies**
```json
{
  "mode": "strict",
  "overflow": "clip", 
  "tolerance": 2,
  "snap": { "grid": 4 }
}
```

## üß™ **Violation Testing**

### **Test Scene Results**
```
üîç Boundary Enforcement Report for 'event-router-violation-test'
üìä Summary: 2 errors, 0 warnings
üìà Processed: 4 nodes, 1 boundaries

‚ö†Ô∏è  Issues Found:
  1. [ERROR] Node 'overflow-depot' escapes boundary 'test-scene-boundary'
  2. [ERROR] Node 'overflow-caption' escapes boundary 'test-scene-boundary'

üîß Auto-fix Suggestions:
  1. [HIGH] Move node 'overflow-depot' to stay within boundary
     Suggested position: (380, 320)
  2. [HIGH] Move node 'overflow-caption' to stay within boundary  
     Suggested position: (164, 384)
```

## üöÄ **Impact and Applications**

This demonstration proves that the **Visual Containment System** can successfully:

1. **Transform Complex Presentations**: Convert multi-scene narratives into bounded, enforceable layouts
2. **Maintain Visual Quality**: Professional styling with automatic position correction
3. **Enable Automated Quality Assurance**: Machine-readable diagnostics catch layout issues
4. **Support Rich Storytelling**: Animated flows and contextual boundaries enhance narrative
5. **Provide Production-Ready Output**: SVG suitable for presentations, documentation, and web use

The EventRouter demonstration showcases how technical concepts can be communicated through visual storytelling while maintaining strict quality standards through automated boundary enforcement.

## üéä **Conclusion**

The **EventRouter Visual Containment Demonstration** successfully proves that complex technical presentations can benefit from contextual boundaries and automated quality enforcement. The school bus metaphor comes to life through six professionally designed scenes, each contained within strict boundaries while maintaining visual appeal and narrative flow.

This implementation demonstrates the full potential of the Visual Containment System for real-world presentation scenarios! üöå‚ú®
