# orchestration-audit-session feature
# AUTO-GENERATED STUB. Replace with real scenarios.

Feature: orchestration audit session
  In order to audit orchestration domain 'orchestration-audit-session'
  As a governance observer
  I want baseline BDD coverage for 'orchestration-audit-session'

  Background:
    Given the system is in a valid state
    And necessary preconditions are met

  # Then: audit placeholder to satisfy scenarios-complete pre-check
  Scenario: Baseline coverage placeholder for orchestration-audit-session
    Given the orchestration audit system is initialized
    When the 'orchestration-audit-session' sequence executes baseline flow
    Then an audit artifact is produced for 'orchestration-audit-session'
    And the artifact conforms to Symphonia schema
    And governance conformity checks pass
