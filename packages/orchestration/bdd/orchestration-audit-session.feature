Feature: orchestration audit session
  In order to audit orchestration domain 'orchestration-audit-session'
  As a governance observer
  I want baseline BDD coverage for 'orchestration-audit-session'

  Scenario: Baseline coverage placeholder for orchestration-audit-session
    Given the orchestration audit system is initialized
    When the 'orchestration-audit-session' sequence executes baseline flow
    Then an audit artifact is produced for 'orchestration-audit-session'
