Feature: orchestration audit system
  In order to audit orchestration domain 'orchestration-audit-system'
  As a governance observer
  I want baseline BDD coverage for 'orchestration-audit-system'

  Scenario: Baseline coverage placeholder for orchestration-audit-system
    Given the orchestration audit system is initialized
    When the 'orchestration-audit-system' sequence executes baseline flow
    Then an audit artifact is produced for 'orchestration-audit-system'
