# graphing-orchestration feature
# AUTO-GENERATED STUB. Replace with real scenarios.

Feature: graphing orchestration
  In order to audit orchestration domain 'graphing-orchestration'
  As a governance observer
  I want baseline BDD coverage for 'graphing-orchestration'

  Background:
    Given the system is in a valid state
    And necessary preconditions are met

  Scenario: Baseline coverage placeholder for graphing-orchestration
    Given the orchestration audit system is initialized
    When the 'graphing-orchestration' sequence executes baseline flow
    Then an audit artifact is produced for 'graphing-orchestration'
