# self_sequences feature
# AUTO-GENERATED STUB. Replace with real scenarios.

Feature: self_sequences
  In order to audit orchestration domain 'self_sequences'
  As a governance observer
  I want baseline BDD coverage for 'self_sequences'

  Background:
    Given the system is in a valid state
    And necessary preconditions are met

  Scenario: Baseline coverage placeholder for self_sequences
    Given the orchestration audit system is initialized
    When the 'self_sequences' sequence executes baseline flow
    Then an audit artifact is produced for 'self_sequences'
