[symphony:dashboard.load]
role: SRE
movementStory: As an SRE, I need the dashboard to load budgets and metrics and compute compliance in ≤1s P95 with accurate telemetry.
beat: loadBudgets -> As an SRE, I need `loadBudgets` to fetch and validate budget data.
beat: loadMetrics -> As an SRE, I need `loadMetrics` to fetch recent metrics reliably.
beat: computeCompliance -> As an SRE, I need `computeCompliance` to calculate status and thresholds deterministically.

[symphony:dashboard.refresh.metrics]
role: SRE
movementStory: As an SRE, I need dashboard refresh to reload metrics and update compliance quickly.
beat: loadMetrics -> As an SRE, I need `loadMetrics` to fetch updated metrics.
beat: computeCompliance -> As an SRE, I need `computeCompliance` to recompute status.

[symphony:dashboard.export.report]
role: SRE
movementStory: As an SRE, I need dashboard export to serialize state and trigger downloads deterministically in ≤1s P95.
beat: serializeDashboardState -> As an SRE, I need `serializeDashboardState` to produce a stable report.
beat: triggerExportDownload -> As an SRE, I need `triggerExportDownload` to initiate download reliably.
