A: Yes, orchestrator wraps and measures them.

**Q: What if build fails?**
A: Exits with status 1, detailed error in report.

**Q: How do I skip a movement?**
A: `node scripts/orchestrate-build-symphony.js --skip=3`

**Q: Where's telemetry stored?**
A: `.generated/build-symphony-report.json`

**Q: How do I change execution intensity?**
A: `--dynamic=p|mf|f|ff`

**Q: Where are the handler functions?**
A: `scripts/build-symphony-handlers.js`

**Q: How do I integrate with CI/CD?**
A: See BUILD_PIPELINE_SYMPHONY.md Integration section
